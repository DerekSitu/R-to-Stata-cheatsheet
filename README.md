# R to Stata Cheatsheet
The do-files are cheatsheets I made to quickly transition to Stata as an experienced R user while following along with these tutorials:
 
- https://comet.arts.ubc.ca/docs/econ_490/index_490_stata.html
- https://libguides.library.nd.edu/data-analysis-stata/tables

They contain example code for basic exploratory data analysis, data wrangling, and producing LaTeX tables.
